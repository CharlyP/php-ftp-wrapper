# Installation from composer

Using [composer](http://getcomposer.org) is the easiest way to use this library.  
Just add the following lines in your `composer.json`

```json
{
    "require": {
        "touki/ftp": "1.0.*"
    }
}
```

Then run

```sh
$ composer install touki/ftp
```

You now should be able to use the library.
